Consecutive Prime Sum

Problem Description

Question â€“ :  Some prime numbers can be expressed as a sum of other consecutive prime numbers.

    For example
        5 = 2 + 3,
        17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7,
        41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.
        Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.

Write code to find out the number of prime numbers that satisfy the above-mentioned property in a given range.

Input Format: First line contains a number N

Output Format: Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less than or equal to N.

Constraints: 2<N<=12,000,000,000
